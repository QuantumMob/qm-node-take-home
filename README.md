# Quantum Mob ES6/Backend Test

## Introduction

This task is meant to test your API design skills as well as ES6 knowledge.

## Requirements and Constraints

1. Use Node.js

## Instructions

You are required to design and implement an API for a new and shiny app
that will be built for car repair shops.

The users of the app are looking to simplify their appointment booking.
Thus, there is a certain amount of functionality that we need to provide to them.

At a very minimum, the user needs to be able to manage their vehicles
including some basic information. They also need to manage their appointments.

It is up to you to decide what information will be saved in the DB, e.i.
you are responsible for the API schema and data structures.

Please submit your results in a separate repository. We are looking
forward to see how you structure your code, what technology you use,
how you make API design decisions what you test, how you document the API etc.

Please do not spend more than 2-3 hours on this task.
