# Quantum Mob ES6/Fullstack Test

## Introduction

This task is meant to test your API design skills, front-end Javascript, as well as ES6 knowledge.

## Instructions

You are required to design and implement an API & a new and shiny web app for car repair shops. Thus, there is a certain amount of functionality that we need to provide to them.

The database is currently set up to use a local MongoDB database.

**To get started:**
1. Install MongoDB locally and start with `sudo mongod`
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Start the project with `yarn start` or `npm run start`

## Requirements and Constraints

1. Use React, Vue, or Angular
2. Use Node.js
3. Use Express

### Frontend

The front-end should consist of at least two views:

1. Dashboard/vehicle list view - display vehicles in a list
2. Vehicle detail/edit view - display details of a vehicle as a form and allow the user to edit and save a vehicle's properties

### Backend

At a very minimum, the user needs to be able to manage their vehicles
including some basic information.

It is up to you to decide what information will be saved in the DB, i.e.
you are responsible for the API schema and data structures.

Please submit your results in a separate repository. We are looking
forward to see how you structure your code, what technology you use,
how you make API design decisions, what type of data you store etc.
